# Machines Making Art

I will be using Processing to allow a machine to modify existing 3D models and create art with minimal human input.

## Summary

The goal of my project is to create a processing sketch that can take a model, modify it without any human input, then render and save this file as it's own model, different from the original. a rudimentary form of "AI making art", so to speak. To do this, i'll be using the HE_Mesh libraries, and parts of some old abandoned code projects from a previous semester, modifying them extensively for both this project, as well as the presentation itself. to extend the "machines making art" idea, i will also be 3D printing the model that this processing sketch produces, and will be passing it around for the class to look at while i present the project.

## Component Parts


This project relies heavily on the HE_mesh library, which has hundreds and hundreds of different components. on top of that, i'm also including 3D printing, which is its own field full of challenges on its own.

## Challenges

The HE_mesh library is INCREDIBLY diverse and extensive, and often hard to really grasp. that, combined with some spotty memory about the older, re-used parts of the project has led to a lot of confusion and difficulty getting it to work.

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 1: Write proposal
- Week 2: Resurrecting the parts of the old, abaondoned project that are relevant to this current idea.
- Week 3: getting the code up and running, producing the modified 3D model, and then printing it for use in the presentation.
- Week 4: Present!
